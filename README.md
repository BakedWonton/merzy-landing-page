# merzy-landing-page

This is the landing page for Munchies with Merzy. Check it out and let me know what you think! 

I will be focusing on HTML, CSS, and some JS for basic functionality. I should have multiple pages and links out to external pages. Formatting is all done in a separate CSS file for organization.

Using Flexbox, and other basic HTML/CSS tools.
